DO YOU TAKE WALK-INS?<br>
Yes! And we even have a bar where you can forget your troubles while you wait to be seated.

DO YOU HAVE A WAIT-LIST?<br>
Yes! There are no guarantees, but tables open up all the time due to cancellations and no-shows. Just give us a call (716) 555-5555 to get on the wait list.

All that info is available right here.
