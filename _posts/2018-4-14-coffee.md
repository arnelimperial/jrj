We brew the best coffee we can find from roasters we trust, tea from farms smaller than 15 acres and cook delicious brunches based on sourdough bread, organic eggs, seasonal fruit + vegetables.

We like to experiment and make as much as we can in house and whatever we can't make comes from producers that aren't based too far away.

Our counter is always stocked with cakes and cookies.
With a bit of notice we can bake things to order. Just send us an email.
