We'll do our best to accommodate whatever dietary restrictions you might have. But sometimes it helps to know about them in advance.

Vegan? Just tell your server when you sit down. All of our dishes can be made vegan, except for one of our sides (Creamed Chard) and as long as your server knows, they can make sure you get the right version of each dish. Unfortunately, right this minute, most of our desserts have a vegan version, but not all.

Gluten-free? Again, just tell your server when you sit down. Several appetizers and entrees can be made gluten-free. Unfortunately, for brunch we have fewer options for our gluten-free guests.

Other allergies? Tell us when you make a reservation so we can be sure we can accommodate you. It's probably best to give us a call (716) 555-5555.
