  <h5 style="color: #007bff;">HOW DO I MAKE A RESERVATION?</h5>
  <p>The best way to see if something is available is to call the cafe (716) 555-5555, and we'll be happy to make one for you. We do not take reservations by email. Sorry!</p>
  <h5 style="color: #007bff;">YOU TAKE WALK-INS?</h5>
  <p>Yes! And we even have a bar where you can forget your troubles while you wait to be seated.</p>

  <h5 style="color: #007bff;">DO YOU HAVE A WAIT-LIST?</h5>
  <p>Yes! There are no guarantees, but tables open up all the time due to cancellations and no-shows. Just give us a call (716) 555-5555 to get on the wait list.</p>

  <h5 style="color: #007bff;">CAN I CHANGE MY RESERVATION?</h5>
  <p>Absolutely. Just give us a call (716) 555-5555.</p>

  <h5 style="color: #007bff;">WHERE ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOUR HOURS? HOW DO I GET THERE?</h5>
  <p>All that info is available right here.</p>

  <h5 style="color: #007bff;">I HAVE DIETARY RESTRICTIONS. WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME?</h5>
  <p>We have detailed info right here but the short answer is:</p>
  <p><strong style="color:#007bff;">Vegan?</strong> Just tell your server when you pay for your orders. All our dishes can be made vegan.</p>
  <p><strong style="color:#007bff;">Gluten-free or Lactose-free?</strong> Just tell your server when you pay your orders. Some of our dishes can be prepared gluten-free. For buffet we have fewer options for gluten-free guests.</p>
  <p><strong style="color:#007bff;">Allergies?</strong> Tell us when you make a reservation and we'll do our best to accommodate you. It's probably best to give us a call (716) 555-5555.</p>

  <h5 style="color: #007bff;">DO YOU SERVE ALCOHOL?</h5>
  <p>Yes, we serve wine.</p>

  <h5 style="color: #007bff;">CAN I BE YOUR INTERN?</h5>
  <p>We want that to happen, too. Just send an email to 9pagemake7@gmail.com with a resume attached or a letter to let us know your current level of experience. Someone will get back to you.</p>
